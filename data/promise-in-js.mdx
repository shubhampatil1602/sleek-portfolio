# JavaScript Promises Made Easy

A Promise represents a value that may be available now, later, or never.

## Creating a Promise

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve("Done!"), 1000);
});
```

## Consuming Promises

```js
promise.then((result) => console.log(result));
```

## Using async/await

```js
async function fetchData() {
  const result = await promise;
  console.log(result);
}
fetchData();
```
