# Welcome to Next.js Basics

Next.js is a React framework that enables developers to build full-stack web applications with ease. It provides a rich set of features like file-based routing, server-side rendering, API routes, and static site generation â€” all with minimal configuration.

## Why Use Next.js?

1. **File-based Routing**: Automatically generates routes based on your file structure.
2. **Pre-rendering**: Supports Static Generation and Server-Side Rendering for optimized performance.
3. **API Routes**: Build your backend with the same framework.
4. **Built-in CSS and Sass support**: Import styles directly into your components.
5. **Image Optimization**: Includes an optimized `next/image` component.
6. **Incremental Static Regeneration**: Update static content without a full rebuild.

## Creating a Next.js Project

To create a new Next.js app:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```
