# JavaScript Array Methods: map, filter, and reduce

These higher-order functions make array manipulation more elegant and concise.

## map()

Transforms every element in an array.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = numbers.map((num) => num * 2); // [2, 4, 6]
```

## filter()

Filters array elements based on a condition.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const even = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0); // [2]
```

## reduce()

Reduces the array to a single value.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0); // 6
```
