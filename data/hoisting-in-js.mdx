# JavaScript Hoisting Explained

Hoisting refers to how JavaScript "lifts" declarations to the top of their scope during compilation.

## Variable Hoisting

```js
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;
```

## Function Hoisting

```js
sayHello(); // Works
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

> `let` and `const` are hoisted too but stay in a temporal dead zone, causing a ReferenceError if accessed before declaration.
